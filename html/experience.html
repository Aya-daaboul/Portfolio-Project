                    Data Science intern @ Salem Group<br>
                    Beirut,Lebanon.<br>September-November<br>
                    In my role as a Data Science Intern at Salem Group, I have been actively supporting the data team with a variety of tasks that leveraged my programming skills specifically in Python. My primary responsibilities include collecting and cleaning data, where I conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using essential and powerful Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy. This experience has not only enhanced my technical abilities in data science but also allowed me to contribute strong communication skills and allowed me to foster to meaningful insights that drive the team's projects forward.</p>

                    Data Team member at AGC-AUB<br>
                    Beirut,Lebanon.<br>July-September<br>
                    As a Data Team Member with All Girls Code at the American University of Beirut, I demonstrated strong communication and attention to detail skills while collecting and cleaning data. I took the initiative to create visualizations using Tableau, which conveyed valuable insights effectively. Additionally, I had the opportunity to teach these visualization techniques to my peers highschoolers or first year uni students, fostering a collaborative learning environment and empowering others with data literacy skills. This experience reinforced my passion for data science and my commitment to promoting diversity in the tech field.</p>
